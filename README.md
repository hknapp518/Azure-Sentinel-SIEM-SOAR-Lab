# Azure-Sentinel-SIEM-SOAR Lab

## Overview

Microsoft Sentinel SIEM + SOAR lab demonstrating identity threat detection, Entra ID attack simulations, KQL analytics rules, Logic App automation, incident response, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping in Azure.

Key areas covered in this project include:
- Microsoft Entra ID identity security
- Conditional Access and MFA enforcement
- Microsoft Defender threat investigation and response
- Microsoft Purview data governance and protection
- Sensitivity labels and auto-labeling policies
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Security monitoring and incident response workflows
- Compliance alignment with NIST 800-171 and CMMC Level 2

The goal of this lab is to demonstrate practical experience with Microsoft security technologies used to reduce attack surface, protect sensitive data, automate governance, and improve organizational security posture.

## Attack Scenarios (Red Team)

- Password spray and brute-force attempts against Azure identities  
- Suspicious sign-in activity (impossible travel, unfamiliar IPs, anomalous location)  
- Unauthorized or excessive access to Azure Blob Storage containing sensitive data  
- Scripted or LLM-assisted generation of adversary scenarios mapped to MITRE ATT&CK  

---

## Detection Engineering (Blue Team)

- Built Microsoft Sentinel analytics rules using KQL to detect identity-based threats  
- Monitored Azure Entra ID sign-in logs, storage access logs, and VM telemetry  
- Correlated multi-source logs for full attack visibility  
- Mapped detections to MITRE ATT&CK cloud techniques  
- Tuned detection rules to reduce false positives and improve accuracy  

---

## Incident Response (Purple Team)

- Investigated alerts using Microsoft Sentinel incident workflows  
- Built and tested SOAR playbooks using Azure Logic Apps  
- Simulated SOC response actions including:
  - User account disablement  
  - IP blocking via network controls  
  - Alert escalation and notification workflows  
- Iteratively improved detection logic based on investigation results

## Technologies Used

- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM + SOAR)  
- Microsoft Entra ID (Identity & Access Management)  
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud  
- Azure Virtual Machines  
- Azure Blob Storage  
- Log Analytics Workspace  
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)  
- Azure Logic Apps  
- MITRE ATT&CK framework alignment  
- Optional: LLM-assisted adversary emulation for scenario generation  

---

## Key Outcomes

- Simulated a full SOC workflow from attack detection to automated response  
- Developed cloud-based detection rules using real Azure telemetry sources  
- Implemented MITRE ATT&CK-aligned detection engineering practices  
- Improved understanding of identity-based threats in cloud environments  
- Demonstrated SOC automation using SOAR playbooks  
- Practiced detection tuning and alert optimization techniques  

---

## Challenges & Learnings

- Designing realistic identity-based attack simulations without relying on traditional Active Directory  
- Building effective KQL queries that balance detection accuracy and false positives  
- Correlating logs across multiple Azure services for complete incident visibility  
- Translating raw telemetry into actionable SOC incidents in Microsoft Sentinel  
- Understanding the importance of detection tuning and alert fatigue reduction

## Key Takeaway

This lab demonstrates a full cloud-native Purple Team lifecycle:

**Attack → Detect → Investigate → Respond → Improve**
